Inclusive Data Infastructure
--

At Microsoft we're very focused on building a culture that is inclusive and supportive for a broad and diverse workforce. Its a [work in progress](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/diversity/inside-microsoft/default.aspx#coreui-contentrichblock-9se7qru). Part of this effort is that every employee is required to write about their own personal efforts to further this objective in their annual Core Priorities and thrice-yearly connects (self performance reviews). We just wrote our Core Priorities last month, so I've been thinking about this topic a lot. Since I don't spend a lot of time hiring people, I mostly think about how my interpersonal interactions create a supportive and inclusive environment for my coworkers.

The first time I did this writing excercise I also wrote about how I was going to focus on making sure that the reports I created were [accessible](https://datasavvy.me/2018/06/06/power-bi-report-accessibility-checklist/). Turns out, I don't spend a lot of time making reports in this job. I spend 95% of my time trying to get the data I need into the format I need it. We'll come back to this. When I do get around to creating reports they are typically a single use, same day, run and gun sorts of affairs. As a result, I felt unsucessful at my stated goal. But I was also unsatisfied to just focus on the interpersonal. Not because the interpersonal is not important. Its *really* important. More important than the other stuff in this post. Its also the bare minimmum.

The other thing I've been spending a lot of time thinking about lately is how we should be evolving the data infastructure used by my part of the company (Microsoft Advertising). I just accepted a new role as a PM to lead the effort to modernize our data infastructure to *Empower every person in Microsoft Advertising to do more with data* [1]. Our vision is centered on the idea that ever person and function in our business is data driven. 
* Our consumer product is data (search)
* Our advertiser product is data
* Our sales pitch is data (CPC, CPA, CTR, ROAS, SOV) 
* Our sales team is compensated based on data
* Our sales leadership manages through data

As a result of our ongoing digital transformation [2], **every person is an analyst**. 

To overcome the headwinds of historical exclusion and to create an inclusive and supportive environment for an empowered diverse workforce, our tools need to be deliberately designed for inclusion. And now that every person is an analyst not now, inclusion needs to be deep in the design of the systems and  infastructure, not just in the design of the visuals.

What is Inclusivity?
--

* [Diversity](https://www.bing.com/search?q=diversity): the practice or quality of including or involving people from a range of different [] backgrounds... 
* [Inclusion](https://www.bing.com/search?q=inclusion): The practice or policy of providing equal access to opportunities.

Microsoft's internal definitions are a bit longer.
* Diversity is the full range of humand and/or organizational differences
* Inclusion is the process of leveraging the power of differences and similarities to effectively integrate everyone into the culture of the organization to achive a comon objective.
  
Put those together and you get something like: 
* *provide equal access to opportunities for people from a range of different backgrounds*.
   
That's what we need to design for. We need to plan for a group of people that have unusual skills and experiences that push the limits of the definitions of their roles. 

We have Sales people that are skilled software developers and we have very sucessful business analysts that can't create their own Power BI reports and others that know 5 programing languages. We have sales managers that were software engineers and engineering PMs that got into Sales Ops. Most of the business analysts that I work with used to be in sales roles. One of our Sales VP was a philosophy professor. I used to be a chemist.

Just in the past year we've a small sample of new sales people we've hired have backgrounds in many fields.
* Software Development
* Power BI
* Graphic Design
* Aerospace Program Management
* Finance
* Data Analytics
* Consulting
* Journalism
* Sales
* Advertising
* Marketing

On the business analyst side, we have many a long list of technical skills represented: Power BI, Excel, Python, R, SQL, SSRS, Tableau, SAS, SAP, Big Query, Red Shift, Hadoop, Hive, Visual Basic, C#, Kusto.

Diversity in professional and technical background will inform the design of our data infastructure in important ways, but it is not the only kind of diversity that is common to our group. We also have an incredible and growing set of cultural and ethnic backgrounds. We have teams on five continents and dozens of cities. All of these different cultures and backgrounds come diverse references for communication, for learning, for story telling, for decision making [3]. Ultimately, these are the behaviors we are empowering to be done more effectively through data.

[2] This post is going to be THICK with Microsoft buzz words because it is about positioning the role of data infastructure at the center of our cultural ethos.
[3] Professional background can have a big impact on this as well. Sterotypically, our cross lake transplants from amazon are much more comfortable with the essay than the slide deck.
